## Motivation
As a physical therapist in the acute care setting, functional outcome measures are a key component of initial assessments. These measures signify how well a patient can care for themselves, mobilize, and indicate how high of a risk for falls/injury they may be.  They not only indicate functional progression over time, but also assist in discharge recommendations when the patient leaves the hospital.  Inpatient rehab hospitals are required by CMS to complete the IRF-PAI, an outcome measure tool which looks at functional scores as well as readmissions, spending, and discharges back to the community.  The results of the PAI are reported to CMS, who then reports out on many different key quality measures (the IRF QRP measures).  These reports are available to the public and can assist individuals in identifying high performing hospitals when an IRF stay is needed.  The results also help CMS identify facilities who may be falling behind the national average or not meeting certain criteria for quality control.
 For this project, I wanted to learn more about the Inpatient Rehabilitation Facility Patient Assessment Instrument (IRF-PAI) and how these measures compare across different CMS regions and to the national averages.  Iâ€™ll also explore relationships between spending, diagnosis groups, and for-profit vs. non-profit hospitals. 

## Questions:
1. How does North Carolina IRFs performance on identified quality measures compare to the national average? 
2. Does organization type seem to have any correlating effect on these measures?
3. Are there any regional differences in regards to performance on quality measures identified for this study?
4. Are there any areas to consider additional need for IRFs in regards to population growth of senior citizens?


## Data Tables Created

## Normalizing the data
- To ensure most recent quality reporting as able, I chose the last three years (2023-2025) to look at.
- As qulaity measures are reported out quarterly, I chose June as my reference point to ensure consistency in regards to length of time between reports. - I also developed a list of specific counties in North Carolina that hold inpatient rehab hospitals, and then used this list throughout the project to ensure consistency in reporting across all measures, regions, and organization type. 

## Problems and Hurdles
In my analysis of the Discharge Function score, I learned that this measure was only recently added to the Quality Reporting Program in 2023. This is the only measure that has data not consistent with the other measures, as it only has about one year of data collected thus far.  

## Technologies Used
I used Python for data analysis and Power BI for creation of visualizations.
